      <p>
        Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect many parts of the
        body. It can be difficult to diagnose and often misunderstood. Our goal
        is to gently educate and support everyone navigating this journey.

        <p>
          Lupus is an autoimmune condition where the immune system, instead of
          protecting the body, mistakenly reacts against healthy tissues. This
          may cause inflammation in areas like the skin and joints. Every lupus
          journey is unique, but support and understanding make all the
          difference.

        <p>
          According to the Lupus Foundation of America, an estimated 5 million
          people worldwide are living with lupus. In South Africa, it's believed
          to affect about 1 in every 1000 people, and many cases may go
          undiagnosed. Lupus is more common in women, but it can affect anyone.
          That's why our mission is to offer support, understanding, and
          connection to everyone navigating this journey.

      <p class="mission-statement">
        Living with lupus can be difficult, but with early diagnosis, proper
        care, and strong support, many go on to live full, meaningful, empowered
        lives.
