          Lupus Together is a safe and welcoming space for people living with
          lupus, their families, and their friends. Whether you are newly
          diagnosed, living with lupus for years, or caring for someone who is,
          this is where connection begins.

        <p>
          We started in 2012 in Cape Town South Africa. A small group of friends
          came together, each with someone close to them affected by lupus. What
          began as a few honest conversations quickly grew into something more.
          A place where people could be seen, heard, and supported without
          judgment.

        Lupus Together was created so no one has to face this condition in
        silence.
